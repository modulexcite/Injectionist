# Injectionist

The Injectionist is a dependency injection tool that can be used to e.g. configure something.

It came to life when Rebus needed a flexible built-in IoC container-like thing that supported decorators. 
Rebus uses it to register stuff throughout the `Configure.With(...)` spell, finally calling 
`injectionist.Get<IBus>()` at the end to resolve the bus and have all of its dependencies injected.


### How to use it?

First, create an `Injectionist` instance:

    var injectionist = new Injectionist();

Then, register a type-to-func mapping in it:

    injectionist.Register<ISomething>(c => new ImplementationOfSomething());

where `ImplementationOfSomething`, obviously, is an implementation of `ISomething`.

If a class has one or more dependencies and needs to have stuff injected, get that stuff from the `IResolutionContext` passed to the func:

    injectionist.Register(c => new HomeController(c.Get<ISomething>()));

Now, let's pretend that I want to decorate `ImplementationOfSomething` with another implementation of `ISomething` - do this:

    injectioninst.Register<ISomething>(c => new SomethingDecorator(c.Get<ISomething>()), isDecorator: true);

The Injectionist will always resolve decorators first, in the order that they're registered in, recursively moving
closer to the primary implementation for each nested call to `c.Get<ISomething>()`.

When the time comes to actually create an instance of something, just `Get` it:

    var instance = injectionist.Get<HomeController>();

It's pretty simple, but it's still kind of neat.

### Is there more?

Not really. Oh, one thing though - the resolution context tracks all instances that it has resolved, allowing you to do stuff like this:

    injectionist.Register(c => {
        var thing = new MyThing();

        thing.Disposed += () => {
             foreach(var disposable in c.GetTrackedInstancesOf<IDisposable>()) {
                  disposable.Dispose();
             }
        };
    });

That is, you can keep the resolution context around (probably by referencing it from an even, just like the code snippet above), and then
use it to go through e.g. all resolves instances that implement `IDisposable`.
